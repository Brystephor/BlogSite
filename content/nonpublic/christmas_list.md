## Christmas 2022 Wish List

note: the sections and lists below are not in any particular order. I added to the list as I thought of stuff.

#### Clothing Items
* Hoodies in a variety of colors (blue, green, brown, black, gray are all great options.)
    * [Target's Goodfellow & Co, size medium](https://www.target.com/p/men-s-fleece-hoodie-goodfellow-co/-/A-85871808?preselect=85631889#lnk=sametab). Target is inconsistent with sizing though so a gift receipt would be greatly appreciated in case the hoodie runs small.
* Casual polarized sunglasses. I like sunglasses that have "rounded square" frames with gray or green lenses.
    * You can think of the [classic rayban wayfarer](https://www.sunglasshut.com/us/ray-ban/rb2140-805289126591) sunglass style (i am happy with any sunglass brand, i do not need raybans).
    * Please no "[sporty](https://www.oakley.com/en-us/product/W0OO9343?variant=888392172174)" sunglasses.
* Comfy at home t-shirts (size medium).
    * Everyone has shirts that they wear at home but wouldn't want to wear in public. I'd like some more of these.

#### Plants
I like plants that are low maintenace, or dark green, or have a lot of vines. A combination of them is awesome.

* [Indoor plant pots](https://bloomscape.com/product/medium-ecopots-round-pot/). An 8 inch or 10 inch diameter pot would be great.
    * I like basic looking indoor pots. 
    * An [indoor repotting kit](https://bloomscape.com/product/repotting-kit-8-pot/) would be even more helpful. I have a philodendron heartleaf and spiderplant that are in need of more space.
* Easy indoor plants
    * [Sansevieria Zeylanica](https://bloomscape.com/product/sansevieria-zeylanica/)
    * Snake plant
* Monstera deliciosa (swiss cheese plant). I like how dense these can get with deep green leaves. 

#### Sports / Activities
* [Outdoor Master Ski goggle lenses](https://www.amazon.com/OutdoorMaster-Ski-Goggles-Replacement-Lens/dp/B07KG3NN9N/ref=sr_1_6?adgrpid=1341404752580458&hvadid=83837868337429&hvbmt=bp&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=111342&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=p&hvtargid=kwd-83838151194168%3Aloc-190&hydadcr=2208_10513401&keywords=ski%2Bgoggles%2Boutdoor%2Bmaster&qid=1669099400&sr=8-6&th=1) in orange.
    * I already have the frames for these lenses so it must be the lense linked above.
* Pickleball paddle.
    * Details are TBD.
* Hydration pack. The items below seem like they would work well. I haven't checked out other brands, but I'm sure other brands have good options too.
    * [CamelBak Zoid Hydration pack](https://www.camelbak.com/recreation/shop/packs/snow/zoid-hydration-pack/CB-2705.html?dwvar_CB-2705_color=Black%2FWhite). Black or gray.
    * [CamelBak Bootlegger Hydration pack](https://www.camelbak.com/recreation/shop/packs/snow/bootlegger-hydration-pack/CB-1341.html?dwvar_CB-1341_color=Black).
    * [CamelBak Powderhound hydration pack](https://www.camelbak.com/recreation/shop/packs/snow/powderhound-12-hydration-pack/CB-2704.html?dwvar_CB-2704_color=Black%2FWhite). Black or gray.


#### Home goods

    * A 18"x18" or 24"x24" acrylic print of this piece: [Westlake Center](https://www.artofjph.com/Prints-by-Donation/i-5hCtbck/A)
